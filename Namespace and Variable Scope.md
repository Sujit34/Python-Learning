## Namespace and Variable Scope

Namespace is basically a system which is use to control all the names(object) we use in our program.It will assure that whatever the name we use is unique and wounld not make any conflict. Namespace allow us to reuse the name.
	
Three types:
-> Built-in - it contains all the built in names.
-> Global - When we import any module that time it creates global namespace. Each module has it's own namespace that's how we can reuse names(objects).
-> Local - When we call a function it will create a it's own namespace that is called as local namespace.

Variable Scope is 4 types:
-> Local - Contains names defined inside the current function.Available on the function only.
-> Global - Contains names defined at the top level of thescript or module. Available onthe whole program.
-> Enclosed - Contains Names defined inside any and all enclosed function.
-> Built-in - Contains names built_in to the python language.

To modify the global variable in local scope we need to use global keyword.
To modify the enclosed variable in local scope we need to use nonlocal keyword.

Python follows LEGB Rules. python first search in Local scope, second search in enclosed scope, third search in global scope finally search in built-in scope. If not found it will through a name error.
